### Jamming Signals Using a HackRF One

#### What is Jamming?

Jamming is the act of intentionally interfering with a radio signal. It can be used to prevent a signal from being received, to corrupt the signal, or to make the signal difficult to understand. Jamming can be used for legitimate purposes, such as to prevent interference between different radio systems, but it can also be used for malicious purposes, such as to disrupt communications or to prevent navigation.

To jam signals using a HackRF One, you will need the following:
- A HackRF One
- GNU Radio
- The gr-osmosdr package
- The osmocom_siggen_nogui utility

##### Commands
```
 sudo apt install gnuradio
 sudo apt install gr-osmosdr
 osmocom_siggen_nogui -h
```

The following command will generate a continuous wave signal at 100 MHz with a power of 10 dBm:

```
osmocom_siggen_nogui -a hackrf -f 100e6 --sweep -x 2e6 -y 10 -v
osmocom_siggen_nogui: This is the command to run the signal generator application. Osmocom-siggen is a versatile signal generator tool that can be used to generate a variety of signals, including constant waves, sinusoidal signals, uniform noise, Gaussian noise, frequency sweeps, GSM bursts, and two-tone signals.
-a hackrf: This option specifies the hardware to use, in this case, the HackRF One. The HackRF One is a software-defined radio (SDR) device that can be used to transmit and receive radio signals. It is a popular choice for jamming because it is relatively inexpensive and easy to use.
-f 100e6: This option sets the frequency to 100 MHz. The frequency of the signal is the number of times per second that the signal oscillates. The frequency of the signal you want to jam will depend on the type of signal you are targeting. For example, if you are targeting a GSM signal, you would need to set the frequency to 900 MHz.
 - sweep: This option indicates that a frequency sweep will be performed. This means that the signal will sweep through a range of frequencies. Frequency sweeps can be used to interfere with a wider range of signals, but they can be less effective at jamming specific signals.
-x 2e6: This option specifies the start frequency of the sweep, which is 2 MHz.
-y 10: This option sets the stop frequency of the sweep, which is 10 MHz.
-v: This option enables verbose mode, providing additional information about the signal generation process.
```

To jam a GSM signal at 900 MHz, you would use the following command:
```
osmocom_siggen_nogui -a hackrf -f 900e6 --sweep -x 890e6 -y 910e6 -v
```


This command would sweep the signal from 890 MHz to 910 MHz, which would interfere with the GSM signal at 900 MHz.

#### Limitations

The primary limitation of jamming signals using a HackRF One is the strength of the signal. The HackRF One is a relatively low-power device, so it can only jam signals that are close to the receiver. Additionally, the HackRF One is susceptible to interference from other radio signals, so it may not be effective in noisy environments. It is important to note that jamming signals is illegal.
